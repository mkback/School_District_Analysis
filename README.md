# School District Analysis

## Overview

### Throughout the module we have been working with Maria to analyze high school test scores in district. After further investigation some test scores at one school were incorrect, skewing the analysis. In this project we updated the Python code to remove this inaccurate data from the results. 


## Results 
#### Once the 9th graders from Thomas High were removed, it affected all results: 
* The district summary metrics all declined slightly. % Overall passing was now 64.9% vs 65.2%
* In the school summary, only Thomas High was affected. % Overall passing was now 90.6% vs 90.9%
* This change only slightly decreased Thomas High's scores so their performance is still the 2nd best school in the district
* In both the math and reading scores by grade, Thomas High now shows "nan"
* Thomas High is in the "$630-644" spending bucket and we saw a slight decrease of this bucket from % overall passing going to 62.78% vs 62.86%
* Thomas High is in the "Medium" size bucket and we saw a slight decrease here as well with % overall passing going to 90.56% vs 90.62%
* Thomas High is in the "Charter" school bucket and we saw a slight decrease here as well with % overall passing going to 90.39% vs 90.43%

## Summary 

In summary, the removal of the grades on Thomas High 9th graders was not a huge impact on the final district results, but did decrease the results across the board. We saw a decrease of less than 1% in the following: total district summary, Thomas High School summary, $630-644 spending bucket summary, medium size school summary and Charter school summary. We also saw that in the math and reading scores by grade, Thomas High has “nan” due to having the data removed.
